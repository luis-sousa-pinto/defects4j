Currently triggering tests for a bug (10 suites of each bug) are split across 10 directories. This step is to bring them all into one directory e.g a directory per bug version.

Current: /home/people/12309511/triggering_tests/Chart/evosuite/1/ multiple *-properties files
Desired: /home/people/12309511/triggering_tests/Chart/10f 11f 12f etc each with ALL the triggering tests in ONE file

Randoop still generating thousands of triggering tests (24,000 in 1 suite) but okay

Iterate through project names and just SBATCH each project to rpevent concurrency issues.

Will check for duplicate test names and not write, will log to log file.

Had to redo output and error file after SBATCHing

A lot more duplicates than initially thought
