Manually removed suites < 5 e.g 4 x Closure(88f, 91f, 100f, 156f) before fixing suites

Ran fix all suites with failed suite dirs logged and some suites were cancelled for taking too long.
Then ran fixed suite per version in these failed Dirs, again logging failed versions.

8 failed

Check how many missing suites between raw and fixed using identify_missing script

16 missing (Closure ones removed were excluded) - missing means backup there but original file not present

Ran fix_missing_scripts for 16 missing. 
0 failed from missing suites

8 failed manually removed (see failed_fix_by_vid.log), also any still missing are noted and a recount of bugs in each category is done given:

Less than 5 suites: 0
5-10 suites: 187
10 suites: 644
Other: 0
Total: 831
