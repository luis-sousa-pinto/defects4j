Generate stats for Major and PIT

Because 19 Major merge jobs didnt work (TIMEOUT log) these are not in the merged_maps directory.
Therefore two Major scripts must be run - Major.py and timeouts.sh
Combine results

RESULTS:

Eligible bugs: 409

PIT:
Bugs <4 suites: 34
Bugs 4+ suites: 375
Bugs 5+ suites: 355

MAJOR:
Bugs <4 suites: 1
Bugs 4+ suites: 408
Bugs 5+ suites: 406

Bugs with 4+ suites in common: 342 bugs
Total number of suites: 2548 suites

Bugs with 5+ suites in common: 315 bugs
Total number of suites: 2440


Run valid_suites_common.sh for suites in common
Two directores:
5+ bugs with bug-suite file
4+ bugs with bug-suite file



Including Dev test suites:
Bugs with 5+ suites in common:
Total bugs: 337 (Up 22 due to dev suites inclusion)
Total suites: 2828

Bugs with 4+ suites in common:
Total bugs: 359 (Up 17 due to dev suites inclusion)

Merge these depending on whether we will use 4+ or 5+ suites
