This step involves extracting all the test methods from the test suites and storing them in a file that is easily accessible.

The reason for this is that Major Mutation only operates at Class level and not Test Method level and hence it is impossible to determine which tests kill which mutants.

However a workaround for this is to run d4j mutation per test method, in order to do this we must have a list of all the test methods in a suite.

This step involves:
Unzipping each suite for each project version
Copy all of the test methods from all of the .java files to a new file "test_methods.txt"
Clean up by removing the unzipped file


NOTES: 	changed name of dir from all_tests to all_test_methods
	changed name of tests.txt to test_methods.txt
	changed name of test_unzips to tmp_unzipped
