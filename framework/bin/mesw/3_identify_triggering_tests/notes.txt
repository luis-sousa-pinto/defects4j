Use Thomas's modifed version so we can see triggering tests per bug version per seed. 

Log any failures to 3/failed_run_bug.log

165 jobs e.g 1 per suite (exclude project that has no randoop/evosuite)

For each failed suite, read from log file and run run_bug_det using -v option to run bug_det per bug in that suite again logging failures to 3/failed_run_bug_by_vid.log

8 failed suites

Ran 608 individual jobs for these failed suites (by_vid)

Only 5 failed by vid, couldn't create trig tests for these therefore remove these from the fixed suites section as they have problems.
